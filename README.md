# Summary about the results of a search in GBIF of forestal species from tropical american countries

The jupyter notebook of this repository was published on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), a tool for sharing programming resources in reproducible and executable environments. Also, Binder allows to create interactive presentations of jupyter notebooks using the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python package.

To autmomatically launch the presentation when it's open, you should add the `autolaunch=true` configuration parameter to the notebook's `livereveal` section in the metadata, as follows:

```
"livereveal": {
        "autolaunch": true
        }
```

This jupyter notebook is available with the following button:

## Acknowledgments

I obtained the trick for launching the jupyter notebook in presentation mode with RISE from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-rise) of the Binder's team.
